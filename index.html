            A healthcare worker is one who delivers care and services to the sick
            and ailing either directly as doctors and nurses or indirectly as aides, 
            helpers, laboratory technicians, or even medical waste handlers.
             There are approximately 59 million healthcare workers worldwide.
              Recognizing the vital role played by health care workers as 
              “the most valuable resource for health
              ” the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared the years 2010 to 2023 as the 
              “The decade of the human resources for health.”

          No longer is one person responsible for the patient's health; today, <br>
          an entire team of health workers comes together to coordinate a patient's well-being <br>
           Health teams help break down hierarchy and centralized power of health organizations, giving more leverage to health workers.
